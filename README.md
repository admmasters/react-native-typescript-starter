React Native Typescript Starter
====
A React Native Typescript starter designed for simplicity.

Motivation
====
This is a React Native project designed to allow people who prefer working with TypeScript to get up and running
quickly with a minimum of ceremony.

Usage
====
To get up and running just execute the below in a terminal session.

```javascript
npm install
```
or

```javascript
yarn
```

Libraries
===
react-native: 0.41.2
typescript: 2.2.1
react: 15.4.0
jest: 19.0.2
tslint: 4.4.2

Typings
===
One of the aims is to make sure all the dependencies (that a user would interact with) are typed.

Recommended Setup
====
Personal recommendation is the excellent Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/ although this will work in
other editors depending on your preference.
